changes:
  - rscadd: Exosuit-mounted hydraulic clamps can now compress scrap into cubes for
      transport. These cubes can then be whacked with a decent amount of force (a
      crowbar should do) to decompress them and release the scrap pile. They can also
      be recycled directly for a reduced amount of materials compared to recycling
      the contents individually - this amount can be increased with better microlasers,
      from 25% to 45% with One Star parts.
  - rscadd: The conveyors disk now has boards for the smelter and sorter. It's also
      been renamed to logistics, and has license points. Conveyor and switch assemblies
      still cost 0 LP, so don't worry.
